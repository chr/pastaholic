Pastaholic: The 1000000th pastebin.

DESCRIPTION

  A pastebin. IOW, copy some code, put it in the box, chose the language,
  and submit: you'll have a copy of the code syntax-highlited. Useful if
  you have to share some snippets of code (e.g., on a mailing list).

  Hard work is actually done by GeSHi: http://qbnz.com/highlighter/

FILES

  Required:
    * pasta.php -> Generates the pastes.
    * index.html -> Interface to the pastebin.
    * geshi.php -> GeSHi.
    * geshi/* -> Syntax files. (You'll need only syntax files you'll use.)

  Optional:
    * pasta_config.ini -> Contains customization.
    * pasta.header.template -> Everything above (and including) '<body>'.
    * pasta.footer.template -> Everithing below (and including) '</body>'.

REQUIREMENTS

  * PHP >= 4.3

CUSTOMIZATION

  pasta_config.ini is the file that contains customization. It's a 'ini'
  file, so it's structured like:

  [section1]
  option1 = somevalue
  option2 = 'some other value'

  (Notice the quotes in option with spaces.)

  Here they are:

  ==== [main] ====

  These are the main options.

  * numbers:   Indicates wheter line numbers should be displayed.
               If not present, no numbers will be shown.
               Possible valuse: 'normal' (all lines are styled the
               same); 'fancy' (lines are styled differently).
